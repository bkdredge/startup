PITCH: If you've tried apps like Duolingo, Pimsleur or Babble, you probably share the same frustrations as all of us. "It's way too slow. The courses are rigid. The owl kept threatening me. It's fun but I suck at speaking Japanese." Luckily for us, there is faster and funner way to learn a foreign language! Enter: Cure Monolingualism. It's an online game that tests and grows your ability to write and speak in your desired language. It's like Duolingo and The Most Dangerous Writing App had a baby! In fact, it is so heavy on your output that it only rewards you when you write and speak complete sentences using words that you are recently learning. You can adjust your fluency level so that you are right on track with your learning goals. You are learning along with thousands of other users around the world who are striving to rack up as many points as they can, week by week. And the real kicker is that even after 15 minutes of it, you can expect to have written 2000 words in your desired language, and have used at least 50 new words and phrases to keep in your vocabulary. -- So, want to cure monolingualism -- in the world, and in yourself? Get on curemonolingualism.com.
FEATURES: Customizable settings for writing/speaking prompts, including the following: language, fluency level (according to ACTFL), point level, topics. You can opt out of a particular prompt. A timer and a checker for spelling and grammar are included. The user may look back at words used and learned through prompts, and see their point values. There is a leaderboard which counts the points of other users. The user may refer to a dictionary on the system when stuck on prompts; they can also get other help on the prompts by clicking the button. Prompts and vocabulary and phrases are assigned by fluency level. The complexity of the prompts correspond to the difficulty of the prompts; that is, the user may progress through the use of higher volumes of words and phrases with higher point values for their prompts.

AWS Services makes it possible to run an actual web server for a super low cost! That's awesome! It was neat to be able to access the server through shell. ssh -i ~/keys/production.pem ubuntu@53.104.2.123 (example of what to do)

AWS Services also makes it possible to purchase a domain name for a cheap price. And I could get any subdomain as welL! This is wonderful! --> Route 53 on AWS, Domains -> Registered Domains, and then Hosted Zones

Look for HTML/CSS/JavaScript things on the web to try new things!

Caddy helps with web security. I can use sudo commands to do this!

Make sure the deploy shell files are in the right repositories. Fork, then clone. Git pull to update local development (Git Bash), nano to open a file, ./ to execute a deploy file. Git push when you're done, and git commit -m "{message}" as well!

CSS Organization is easier with classes (HTML class = ""; CSS .class) and identifiers (HTML id = ""; CSS #id). I can easily find inspiration for animations, and find pngs that have transparency to create interesting parallax effects.

Use CSS Grid and Flex to assist in page organization. @media can be used to reorganize the page depending on width and height of window resolution.
