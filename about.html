      <p>If you've tried apps like Duolingo, Pimsleur or Babble, you probably share the same frustrations as all of us. "It's way too slow. The courses are rigid. The owl kept threatening me. It's fun but I suck at speaking Japanese."</p>
      <p>Luckily for us, there is faster and funner way to learn a foreign language!</p>
      <p>Enter: Cure Monolingualism.</p>
      <p>It's an online game that tests and grows your ability to write and speak in your desired language. It's like Duolingo and The Most Dangerous Writing App had a baby! In fact, it is so heavy on your output that it only rewards you when you write and speak complete sentences using words that you are recently learning. You can adjust your fluency level so that you are right on track with your learning goals. You are learning along with thousands of other users around the world who are striving to rack up as many points as they can, week by week. And the real kicker is that even after 15 minutes of it, you can expect to have written 2000 words in your desired language, and have used at least 50 new words and phrases to keep in your vocabulary.</p>
      <p>So, want to cure monolingualism -- in the world, and in yourself? Get on curemonolingualism.com.</p>
